Hi, I'm Jason Parker! I'm a versatile mathematician and aspiring data analyst currently serving as a Postdoctoral Scholar in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Calgary and actively seeking to transition into a full-time role in data analytics. Combining a PhD in Mathematics and Statistics with over five years of hands-on experience in research and teaching, I am now focused on honing my data analytics skills. Along with completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have also completed professional courses and data analysis projects in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and R. Eager to broaden my expertise, I am also set to undertake professional courses and projects in Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Python in the near future. My academic journey also includes an MSc in Logic and Computation from Carnegie Mellon University and a BA Honours in Philosophy (specializing in Formal Logic) from Queen's University. I'm passionate about leveraging my exceptionally strong analytical and quantitative background to make meaningful contributions in the field of data analytics.
