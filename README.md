Hello, I'm Jason Parker! 

I am a highly skilled and detail-oriented PhD mathematician seeking to transition into a full-time role in data analytics, with over five years of experience in mathematical research and teaching. Along with completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and the Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization on Coursera, I have also completed professional courses and multiple data analysis projects in Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python, and R. I'm passionate about leveraging my exceptionally strong analytical and quantitative background to make meaningful contributions in the field of data analytics.

My current data analysis portfolio projects may be found [here](https://github.com/jasonparker1991/DataAnalysisPortfolioProjects/blob/main/README.md).
