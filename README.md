Hi, I'm Jason Parker! I am a mathematician, statistics instructor, and data analyst in training.

I am currently employed as a Postdoctoral Scholar in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Calgary in Calgary, AB, Canada, where I conduct research in mathematics and teach university courses in statistics. I am currently developing my data analysis skills and expertise in order to transition into a full-time role in data analytics.

I have a PhD in Mathematics and Statistics, which I obtained from the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, ON, Canada in 2020. Prior to that, I obtained an MSc in Logic and Computation from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, and before that, I obtained a BA Honours in Philosophy (specializing in Formal Logic) from Queen's University in Kingston, ON, Canada. 

Along with completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have completed professional courses and data analysis projects in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and R. In the near future I will also complete professional courses and data analysis projects in Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Python.

My current data analysis portfolio projects may be found [here](https://github.com/jasonparker1991/DataAnalysisPortfolioProjects/blob/main/README.md).
